Project One - Sprint One 

Intoduction:
The projects aim is to get all the imdb user ratings from the API key and return the title, Year, Director, and Rating of the movies 
on IMDB.The aim of sprint 2 is to take the existing dating found from the imdb API key and return the data and then import the data into a database, the 
database file get created with table. In Sprint 3 I added more data using the existing APIs and put them into the existing databases. Finally for Sprint 4 
I added a GUI(graphical user interface) so the user can pick the data they would like to view or choose to update the data.
 
Issues:
Had an API Issue and was unable to get the update data button working without error.
