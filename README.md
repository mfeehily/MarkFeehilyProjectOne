Project One

Introduction:
The projects aim is to get all the imdb user ratings from the API key and return the title, Year, Director, and Rating of the movies 
on IMDB.The aim of sprint 2 is to take the existing dating found from the imdb API key and return the data and then import the data into a database, the 
database file get created with table. in Sprint 3 I added more dating from the APIs to be added into the databases. Finally Sprint 4 was to take the data and 
make a gui(graphical user interface) for the user to pick the data to be displayed or if they would like to update the data. 

Issues:
still having issues when running the code and the update data button not working.
